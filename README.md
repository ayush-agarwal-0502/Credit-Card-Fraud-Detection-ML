## Code :

The code is availaible at : (in this repository itself ) .

## The Dataset :

The data was taken from Kaggle site : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud .

I have also uploaded a copy of this dataset on this repository just in case this dataset is removed : .

The Columns do not have physical significance directly visible since as per the source (Kaggle) , the data was compressed using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) in order to protect the privacy of the individuals while making a realistic secnario dataset availaible to public .
